                        While the Supreme Court has yet to rule on artificial intelligence cases, there 
                        have been a number of cases that have been ruled on by lower courts. These can 
                        help indicate how the Supreme Court might rule in future cases regarding AI.

                    Bartz Graeber and Johnson v. Anthropic PBC.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this case, a judge from the United States District Court of Northern California 
                    ruled that an AI model using copyrighted books for its training was fair use,
                    as long as the material was legally aquired. The judge ruled that the way the AI used
                    the material was transformative enough for fair use to apply.

                <h3>
                    Thaler v. Perlmutter
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled
                    that an airtificial intelligence divice is not eligible for copyright protection.
                    This was based on previous precedent that a human being is the only thing that can 
                    apply for copyright protection.

                <h3>
                    Saber v. Navy Federal Credit Union.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This case originally did not have anything to do with AI, but it ended up having an 
                    important ruling regarding AI. The plaintiff sued the defendent and lost. The plaintiff
                    then appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. In their argument, the apellant
                    cited several cases that did not exist. It was revealed that the appellant used an
                    AI device to prepare his case. When these fake citations removed, the Court found that 
                    the apellant "waived their issue" on the case. This led to another issue with the 
                    fake cases being cited. Online resources have no choice but to include the fake cases
                    in the text, but the cases are fake so they cannnot link to real cases. The general
                    consensus around this dilema is to issue a disclaimer indicating that the citations 
                    are fake. This case, which on principle has nothing to do with AI, might end up being
                    one of the most important regaring how courts handle AI regarding fake generated cases.
