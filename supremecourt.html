                    Supreme Court rulings on technological issues
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        The Supreme Court has yet to make any rulings regarding how the law applies to artificial 
                        intelligence. The closest we have to a ruling was in 2023 when they declined to hear a case
                        regarding if an AI would be eligible for copyright protection. the lower court ruled that
                        copyright was only obtainable by humans. SInce we have no rulings on AI, we have to look
                        at past examples regarding rulings on technology.

                <h3>Riley v. California</h3>
                    <p>
                        This case stated that to search digital data on a phone, a warrant is required. When someone is 
                        under suspicion it is allowed to search them and use those belongings as evidence. The justification
                        for this is that there is the potential of risk associated with the person. With data on a digital
                        device, there is no immediate risk for anyone in the immediate vicinity. Thus, a warrant is required 
                        to search digital data.
                    </p>
                <h3>Carpenter v. Untited States (2018)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The issue in this case is whether the government can subpeona third party companies to obtain
                        records of an individuals cell phone. The Court ruled that a cell phone essentially acts as an 
                        extension of the person, and so a a search of this type would violate the fourth ammendment.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            One more thing to bring up is how it might be harder to find reliable
                            information regarding supreme court decisions regarding AI. I searched whether the supreme court had
                            ruled on AI, and the first thing that popped up was that the Supreme Court had made a decision on the use 
                            of artificial intelligence in the judicial process. The source named in was an AI site. I have found
                            no other evidence that this actually happened, and I am certain that it is entirely untrue. It is very
                            important to use credible sources to find out if a Supreme Court case even happened.
