                <h2>
                    We can help you understand how the law is adapting to new technologies
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        In this current age we live in, where technological advancements are
                        happening at a rapid pace, particularly around generative AI, we can offer you insights into how the law will respond to these new technologies.
                        We will explain how current laws apply to new technologies, and what new laws are 
                        being proposed to address the challenges and opportunities presented by these advancements.
                    </p>
                <h3>Federal Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will explore how federal laws have been adopted in the past to address new technologies.
                        We will then see if we can predict how current federal laws will be applied to generative AI
                        and other new technologies. We will also look at recent legislative proposals that aim to regulate
                        new technologies at the federal level.
                    </p>
                <h3>Supreme Court Rulings</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will examine past rulings from the Supreme Court that have set precedents 
                        for how new technologies are treated under the law. This will be examining how the current law
                        will be applied to generative AI and other new technologies. We will also look at some recent cases
                        that have been brought before the Supreme Court that involve new technologies.
                    </p>
                <h3>State Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will look at how different states have approached the regulation of new technologies.
                        State Laws can differ on even the most basic aspects, such as the definition of what 
                        generative AI is. These can help us determine what the future might be as we compare and contrast
                        different approaches to regulating new technologies.
                    </p>
                <h3>Lower Court Rulings</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will analyze recent rulings from lower courts that have dealt with cases involving new technologies.
                        These rulings can provide insights into how the law is evolving in response to technological advancements.
                        Like with State Laws, we this will allow us to examine different approaches to how the current law
                        deals with new technologies.
